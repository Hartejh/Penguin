# Penguin Species Classification
_Logistic Regression and SVM applied to Palmer Penguins dataset_

This project builds a classification pipeline for identifying penguin species, comparing Logistic Regression and SVM models.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Logistic Regression accuracy: 96.9%  
- SVM with RBF kernel accuracy: 98.5%  
- Stratified k-fold cross-validation: 96.25% (Logistic Regression), 98.5% (SVM)  
- Improved interpretability with coefficient analysis and decision boundary plots  
- Demonstrated model robustness and assumptions checking  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
